# GIT REPOSITORY

#### Git is a cetral repository used for maintaining and tracking changes to files and directories. It is an essential part of the Git version control system, which facilitates collaborative development and allows several developers to work on a project at once.

## To initialiaze git repository

#### The git init command is what you'll use to start a new repository. Git init is a one-time command you use to start up a new repository for the first time. A new.git subdirectory will be created in your current working directory after you run this command. Additionally, it will produce a new main branch.

### Change into an old branch

#### You can switch between the branches generated by git branch using the git checkout command. When a branch is checked out, the files in the working directory are updated to match the branch's version, and Git is instructed to keep track of any subsequent commits to that branch.

### Merging branches

#### Use git checkout to switch to the branch you want to merge into before merging branches locally. Usually, this branch is the primary branch. The other branch's name should then be specified in this branch using git merge.
